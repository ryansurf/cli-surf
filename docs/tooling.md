## [Dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle)

When using Docker Compose to spin up the app, a dozzle container is deployed. 
This can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/` to view live Docker logs. 

> **_NOTE:_** Dozzle logs are not persistent - nothing is stored, it is just a real-time log viewer for Docker containers
